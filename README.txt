OptiWDS which is a GA-based, C-Language Program derived from Guimbaâ€™s OptiPipe was developed, validated, and then integrated into the OWA-EPANET Toolkit to yield a cost-effective design that solves the negative pressures in a WDS System. OptiWDS was found to provide a more cost-effective WDS solution in a more time-efficient way compared to OptiPipe for any WDS size.
